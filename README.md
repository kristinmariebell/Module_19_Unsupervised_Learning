# Module_19_Unsupervised_Learning
Hello! 
Please find my submissin for the Module 19 Assignment. 
I was able to scale the data and perform all unsupervised learning techniques 
by utilizing the harness codes demonstrated in class.

It looks like my graphs are not appearing in the jupyter notebook that I added
to this repo, so I've added a folder of screenshots of the various graphs produced.
Thank you!
